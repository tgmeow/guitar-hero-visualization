# guitar-hero-visualization IN PROGRESS NOT READY FOR USE LOL NOT EVEN CLOSE
This is the C++ port of the application. Development will hopefully continue similarily to the 
main Java version.

Project layout will be similar but not exactly the same. Formatting will use clang-format.


## Roadmap
- Set up (GLFW)[https://github.com/glfw/glfw] maybe probably (?) something OpenGL.
- Figure out how to do the basics that Processing does with C++ OpenGL
- Proceed to set up core functionality of app
- Set up other functionality (threading, events, read in from file and things)

Visualizes the Guitar Hero Project from Vanderbilt's Data Structures class.
This branch project uses a similar object model and ~~is in a different language~~ but greatly extends the functionality of the basic Queue data structure required for the original project.
