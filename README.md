# guitar-hero-visualization IN PROGRESS NOT READY FOR USE LOL NOT EVEN CLOSE
This is the C++ port of the application. Development will hopefully continue similarily to the 
main Java version.

3/14/2017 UPDATE: After getting distracted by school and things and running into way too many difficulties with the kind of low level programming in GLFW, I have decided to try to use something else and see if it works better. [http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/] should be good for the simple line drawings that I need and [http://www.portaudio.com/] MIGHT be good for the audio I want.

Project layout will be similar but not exactly the same. Formatting will use clang-format.


## Roadmap
- ~~Set up (GLFW)[https://github.com/glfw/glfw] something OpenGL.~~
- ~~Figure out how to do the basics that Processing does with C++ OpenGL~~
- Proceed to set up core functionality of app
- - (copy) Main GuitarHeroVisual (started)
- - (copy) GuitarString (done)
- - (copy) StringComponent (nearly up to date)
- - (copy) StringManager (nearly up to date)
- - (new)  GH_Reactor (started)
- - (copy) KeyMap (TO DO)
- - (copy) StdAudio (TO DO)
- - (copy) EventQueue (TO DO)

- - (remove?) Runnable Object or Callback (TO DO)
- - (copy) Button (TO DO)
- - (copy) Menu Things (TO DO)

- Set up other functionality (threading, events, read in from file and things)

Visualizes the Guitar Hero Project from Vanderbilt's Data Structures class.
This branch project uses a similar object model and ~~is in a different language~~ but greatly extends the functionality of the basic Queue data structure required for the original project.
